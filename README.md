# Traffix

Traffix is a personal project that utilizes web scraping techniques with Puppeteer to gather traffic information from the largest traffic providers, such as Google Maps, Waze, and more. Using this data, it calculates drive time averages by days, weeks, months, and more.

The backend of Traffix is powered by Node.js, providing the necessary APIs and handling data processing tasks. The data is stored in a MongoDB database, ensuring efficient and scalable data management.

Additionally, I'm developing a Telegram bot for the UI, allowing users to access the traffic data conveniently and receive updates directly on their devices.

## Getting Started
